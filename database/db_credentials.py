# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the webapp.py to interact with the database
# You can also use environment variables

# For Local Devlelopment

db = 'books_and_flicks'


# For OSU Flip Servers

# host = 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu'      # MUST BE THIS
# user = '<your-cs-340-db-username-here>'       # don't forget the CS_340 prefix
# passwd = '<your-password-here>'               # should only be 4 digits if default
# db = '<name-of-database-on-osu-server>'
